# TodoApiApp

## Objectives
1. Fetch an API to get the list of users
2. Display user information
3. Make each card expandable
4. Add "view todos" page
5. Fetch an API to get the specific users todos
6. Add a "sort by" dropdown to sort by either ID or alphabetically
7. Each todo needs a checkbox on the left, and a delete icon on the right
8. If the checkbox is changed, a PATCH method should be sent to the API to update the 'completed' element. 
9. If the delete icon is pressed, the text should be crossed out and a DELETE method should be sent to the API for that todo, in order to "delete" it.
10. Add a {completed}/{total} area to the app, so the user can see how many todos they have completed.
11. Update the {completed}/{total} variables so the user can see the changes in real-time.

## Extra
 - The app uses the BLoC Architectural Pattern
